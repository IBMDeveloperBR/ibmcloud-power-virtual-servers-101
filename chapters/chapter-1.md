## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Why use IBM Power Systems?

### 1.2. Virtual Power Systems infrastructure environment

IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers are an Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering available at IBM Cloud. Virtual servers built on top of Power processor systems are co-located physically and connected through low-latency networks to IBM Cloud data centers. Consumers which traditionally relied only on on-premises infrastructure can now tap Power Systems infrastructure on demand in a public cloud environment.

At the data centers, the Power Virtual Servers infrastrucutre is physically separated from the standard x86 machines through a fenced network, which is also directly attached to storage. However, it is possible to connect Power Virtual Servers with other IBM Cloud public or on-premises infrastructure if desired. This architecture is identical to the on-premises Power Systems, and allows Power Virtual Servers to retain the same Enterprise Certifications from its on-premises counterpart.
