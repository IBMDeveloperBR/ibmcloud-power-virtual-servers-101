# IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers on IBM Cloud

## Hands-On Lab 1: Provisioning and managing Power Virtual Servers

### Prerequisites

Before you create your first IBM Power Systems Virtual Server instance, review the following prerequisites:

1. [Create an IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) (must be a *pay-as-you-go* account, as there is no Lite plan for IBM Power Virtual Servers).
2. Review the Identity and Acess management (IAM) information at [Managing Power Systems Virtual Servers (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-managing-resources-and-users).
3. [Install the IBM Cloud Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-install-ibmcloud-cli).

### Create a Power Systems Virtual Server Group for a specified IBM Cloud Region

- Access the Power Systems VS Group provisioning page in the IBM Cloud Catalog:

[![service-card](../../images/service-card.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/power-systems-virtual-server)

- Select a location (IBM Cloud Region) for your LPARs from the drop-down menu:

![image-1](../../images/lab1-1.png)

- Overview the only pricing plan available then give a `Service name` and select a `Resource Group` for your IBM Power Systems VS Group. Add `tags` if desired as well, accept the Terms and click on the blue create button on the right-side panel (you will not be charged yet).

![image-2](../../images/lab1-2.png)

- Go to the [IBM Cloud Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) and filter services by Product=power. You should be able to see your Power Systems VS Group listed and its status. Wait until your service is **Active** then click on it.

### Generate SSH keys for accessing your Power Virtual Server instances

- You must use the available operating system options to create SSH keys. To generate SSH keys on a Linux or MacOS system, you can use the standard `ssh-keygen` tool to generate SSH keys interactively:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

- Copy the public SSH key contents (stored in the generated .pub file) to the clipboard:

```bash
cat .ssh/<your_ssh_key_name>.pub
```

- Go to the Power System VS Group page at IBM Cloud Web Console and click on "SSH Keys" on the left-side panel, and then on the blue "Create SSH Key +" button, as shown in the following image:

![image-4](../../images/lab1-4.png)

- Give a name for your SSH Key and paste the copied contents into the "public key" form:

![image-5](../../images/lab1-5.png)

### Creating an AIX VM with the IBM Cloud Web Console

- After creating your SSH key, Click on "Virtual server instances" on the left-side panel, and then on the blue "Create instance +" button on the right side of the screen. You should be redirected to the LPAR creation form:

![image-6](../../images/lab1-6.png)

- Select the desired values for each option. Example:

    - Instance name = `my_aix_vm`
    - Number of instances = `2` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - (Optional) Colocation rules = `No preference` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - (Optional) Naming convention = `Numerical postfix` (select from the radio options)
    - VM pinning = `Off` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - SSH Key = `my-ssh-keys` (select previously created keys from the drop-down menu)
    - Operating system = `AIX` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - Image = `7200-05-01` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - Storage tier = `Tier 3 (3 IOPs / GB)` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - Machine type = `s922` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - Core type = `Shared uncapped` (select from the radio options)
    - Cores (Entitld CPUs) = `1`
    - Memory (GB) = `2`
    - (Optional) Storage volumes [Create volume]:
        - Name = `my-shared-storage`
        - Shareable = `On` (select from the drop-down menu)
        - Size (10GB-2TB) = `10 GB` (select from the drop-down menu)
        - Quantity (create multiple storage volumes at once) = `1`
        - Tier = `Tier 3 (3 IOPs / GB)` (select from the drop-down menu)
    - Network interfaces:
        - Public networks (enable for access from the public internet) = `On`
        - (Optional) Private networks = `None`

### (Optional) Creating an AIX VM with the IBM Cloud CLI

- Log-in at IBM Cloud with the command-line interface:

```bash
ibmcloud login
```

- Make sure you are targeting the correct Cloud Region, Resource Group, and Cloud Foundry Space/Org, example:

```bash
ibmcloud target -r <region> -g <resource_group> --cf
```

- You can optionally list all available IBM Cloud CLI plugings with:

```bash
ibmcloud plugin repo-plugins
```

- Install the `power-iaas` plugin:

```bash
ibmcloud plugin install power-iaas
```

- Verify that the `power-iaas` plugin was installed successfully:

```bash
ibmcloud plugin list
```

- List the IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers services created in your IBM Cloud Region/Resource Group and copy its CRN value:

```bash
ibmcloud pi service-list
```

- Target your previously created IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers service:

```bash
ibmcloud pi service-target <your_service_crn>
```

- (Optional) attach SSH keys to your IBM Power Systems VS service with the IBM Cloud CLI. Copy the contents of a local SSH public key (.pub) file previously generated (if you are on Linux or MacOS you can use the `ssh-keygen` tool to do this):

```bash
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCtuQnQOc2k4zaGzE7b3xUMCjUy++s/9O9HE4fXSm7UNKoTY39zjQ8mhOwaA3HEo12tOdzdFDYHHWNOYufCcFFk61CAL6HyQGGClib1nFc1xUcgTI9Dee8zzaAsN8mIIr1CgbRELhvOsTv23U4QddpfjkcVoKfF0BAtxgauvooQdPZBoxa2rsD+BvcWnjglkYWG2aBbuzFvSl1fLMihjfej8w1lxbcsYEcJg2X96NJPLmLsEJ+XwoXfVuv0X4z8IoBzZ8UbyTlrDv73EAH34GViYfZFbrIaNnwnz/f/tuOKcINihH72YP+oZn9JeiHQ+hKpMqJAmOK2UIzYr3u+79n9 testkey
```

- (Optional) Use the `key-create` command from `ibmcloud pi` to attach the SSH key to your IBM Power Systems VS Service:

```bash
ibmcloud pi key-create testkey --key "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC
1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCtuQnQOc2k4zaGzE7b3xUMCjUy++s/9O9HE4fXSm7UNKoTY39zjQ8mhOwaA3HEo12tOdzdFDYHHWNOYufCcFFk61CAL6HyQGGClib1nFc1xUcgTI9Dee8zzaAsN8mIIr1CgbRELhvOsTv23U4QddpfjkcVoKfF0BAtxgauvooQdPZBoxa2rsD+BvcWnjglkYWG2aBbuzFvSl1fLMihjfej8w1lxbcsYEcJg2X96NJPLmLsEJ+XwoXfVuv0X4z8IoBzZ8UbyTlrDv73EAH34GViYfZFbrIaNnwnz/f/tuOKcINihH72YP+oZn9JeiHQ+hKpMqJAmOK2UIzYr3u+79n9 testkey"
SSHKey created: testkey
```

- (Optional) To confirm that the key was successfully added, use the following command to list all SSH keys:

```bash
ibmcloud pi keys
```

- Create a Public Network for your Power Virtual Servers instances:

```bash
ibmcloud pi network-create-public <my_public_network_name>

ID                3ae41c6e-af51-4c5e-8488-ee667d8fbb16   
Name              <my_public_network_name> 
Type              pub-vlan   
VLAN              2019   
CIDR Block        192.168.128.184/29   
IP Range          [192.168.128.186192.168.128.190]   
Public IP Range   [52.117.37.186  52.117.37.190  ]   
Gateway           192.168.128.185   
DNS               -
```

- You can now create a new VM with the public key attached by using the following command (replacing the options with your own):

```bash
ibmcloud pi instance-create <my_new_AIX_vm_name> \
    --image 7200-03-03 \
    --memory 2 \
    --networks <my_public_network_name> \
    --processors 1 \
    --processor-type shared \
    --key-name <my_attached_ssh_key_name>

```

You can now wait until the new AIX VM is provisioned.
